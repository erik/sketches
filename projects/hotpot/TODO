TODO

More web endpoints
  - Vector tiles
  - Activity as GeoJSON
  - Known property keys? For a UI dropdown

Customization
  - Support AND/OR/NOT for property filters
  - Dynamic gradients + stops
  - Vary gradient stops based on zoom level

CLI
  - Render arbitrary LatLng bounds rather than tile
  - Filter support

Misc
  - "privacy zones" rather than start/end trim distance
  - Strip noisy points from tracks (e.g. inside buildings, etc.)
  - Remap column names from Strava API to match `activities.csv` (or vice versa?)
