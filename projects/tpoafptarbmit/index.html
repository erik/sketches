        The Passage of a Few People Through a Rather Brief Moment in Time (An archive)
      </h1>

      <p class="text-justify text-gray-900 ">
        From 2009-2019, The Passage of a Few People Through a Rather Brief Moment in
        Time explored far-flung areas of Los Angeles on bike. Departing from
        Koreatown's California Donuts #21, each Wednesday night we set out on a unique
        route based around a different theme. Sometimes historical, sometimes
        conceptual, often nonsensical, sometimes a game, our routes aimed to give
        participants a balance between seeing new things and seeing old things
        anew. Convinced that bicycle infrastructure encompasses much more than bike
        lanes and river paths, we climbed hills, wandered off-road, and ventured
        underground to manifest unexpected connections between otherwise disconnected
        places.
