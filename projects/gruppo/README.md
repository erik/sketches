Blog generator using Google Drive for storage and Google Docs as a
WYSIWYG editor.

The idea is that Google Docs is actually not awful to use on a phone,
and works offline, so you can write a post with spotty cell service and
it will automatically get synced next time you're online.

Works as a proof of concept, but a lot of core functionality is missing.
I don't suggest actually using this.
