* Customizability
- Preprocessing: which ways to consider
- Routing profiles: language, runtime evaluation


* Completeness / correctness
- Ingest DEM (SRTM) data for elevation consideration
- Turn restrictions
- One way streets etc. (directed graph)
- Route from offset along edge rather than vertex to vertex


* "real-world" stuff
- Split out pre-processing OSM data from web server by ser/de graph
  rather than regenerating.
- Split world into 5x5 degree tiles (a la Brouter) so that the entire
  graph need not be in memory
- Turn costs
- "Baking" routing profiles into preprocessed data for faster search
  (and reduced flexibility)


* Fantasy land / Performance
- Landmark A* (would this work with tiling?)
- Compact graph representation (bitvectors, etc.)
- Bidirectional A*
- Just in time compilation for dynamic routing profile evaluation
- Segmentation of routing network into dynamically chosen pieces (rather than tiling)
